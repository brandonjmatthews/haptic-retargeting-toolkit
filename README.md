# Haptic Retargeting Toolkit

A toolkit for integrating haptic retargeting in immersive virtual and mixed reality experiences using 'hand redirection'.

The Remapped Interfaces Toolkit uses this toolkit as a basis for remapping between physical and virtual interfaces.

This toolkit was developed as part of
