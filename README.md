# Haptic Retargeting Toolkit

This is a toolkit for integrating haptic retargeting in immersive virtual and mixed reality experiences using 'hand redirection'. This was developed as part of my PhD research and thesis: [Dynamic Haptic Interfaces in Virtual Reality](https://find.library.unisa.edu.au/discovery/fulldisplay/alma9916843624701831/61USOUTHAUS_INST:ROR)

This toolkit is primarily aimed towards what is commonly called "Body Warp" haptic retargeting.

Please also check out [HaRT](https://github.com/AndreZenner/hand-redirection-toolkit), another toolkit with some additional warping methods included and support for blink based hand redirection.
